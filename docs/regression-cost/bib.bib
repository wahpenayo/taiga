In that time, the software has been rewritten entirely from scratch, evolved substantially and now accompanies a text on data mining [35]. These days, WEKA enjoys widespread acceptance in both academia and business, has an active community, and has been downloaded more than 1.4 million times since being placed on Source-Forge in April 2000. This paper provides an introduction to the WEKA workbench, reviews the history of the project, and, in light of the recent 3.6 stable release, briefly discusses what has been added since the last stable version (Weka 3.4) released in 2003.}

    abstract = {{The application of cutting-edge statistical methodology is limited by the capabilities of the systems in which it is implemented. In particular, the limitations of R mean that applications developed there do not scale to the larger problems of interest in practice. We identify some of the limitations of the computational model of the R language that reduces its effectiveness for dealing with large data efficiently in the modern era. We propose developing an R-like language on top of a Lisp-based engine for statistical computing that provides a paradigm for modern challenges and which leverages the work of a wider community. At its simplest, this provides a convenient, high-level language with support for compiling code to machine instructions for very significant improvements in computational performance. But we also propose to provide a framework which supports more computationally intensive approaches for dealing with large datasets and position ourselves for dealing with future directions in high-performance computing. We discuss some of the trade-offs and describe our efforts to realizing this approach. More abstractly, we feel that it is important that our community explore more ambitious, experimental and risky research to explore computational innovation for modern data analyses.}},

	maps in which the sizes of geographic regions such as countries or
	provinces appear in proportion to their population or some other
	analogous property. Such maps are invaluable for the representation
	of census results, election returns, disease incidence, and many
	other kinds of human data. Unfortunately, to scale regions and still
	have them fit together, one is normally forced to distort the regions'
	shapes, potentially resulting in maps that are difficult to read.
	Many methods for making cartograms have been proposed, some of them
	are extremely complex, but all suffer either from this lack of readability
	or from other pathologies, like overlapping regions or strong dependence
	on the choice of coordinate axes. Here, we present a technique based
	on ideas borrowed from elementary physics that suffers none of these
	drawbacks. Our method is conceptually simple and produces useful,
	elegant, and easily readable maps. We illustrate the method with
	applications to the results of the 2000 U.S. presidential election,
	lung cancer cases in the State of New York, and the geographical
	distribution of stories appearing in the news.},

	tools. In the words of Chatfield ``...students typically know the
	technical details of regression for example, but not necessarily
	when and how to apply it. This argues the need for a better balance
	in the literature and in statistical teaching between techniques
	and problem solving strategies.'' Whether analyzing risk factors,
	adjusting for biases in observational studies, or developing predictive
	models, there are common problems that few regression texts address.
	For example, there are missing data in the majority of datasets one
	is likely to encounter (other than those used in textbooks!) but
	most regression texts do not include methods for dealing with such
	data effectively, and texts on missing data do not cover regression
	modeling.},

	In-depth discussions of regression analysis, analysis of variance,
	and design of experiments are followed by introductions to analysis
	of discrete bivariate data, nonparametrics, logistic regression,
	and ARIMA time series modeling. Concepts and techniques are illustrated
	with a variety of case studies. S-Plus, R, and SAS executable functions
	are provided and discussed. S functions are provided for each new
