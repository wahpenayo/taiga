\section{Typesetting}

This document was typeset using Mik\TeX{} $2.9$ \cite{Miktex2017} 
and {\TeX}works $0.6.1$ \cite{Texworks2017} 
on \textsc{Windows} $10$. 
I used \texttt{arara} \cite{arara2017} 
to run \texttt{xelatex}, \texttt{biber}, \texttt{makeglossaries},  and
\texttt{makeindex}.
I believe only Mik\TeX\  and {\TeX}works are Windows specific; 
the actual typesetting tools should be usable on Linux and MacOS as well.
